- 👋 Hi, I’m @StumpyScot
- 👀 I’m interested in D&D and how it can help individuals grow as people, as well as so many professional subjects that it feels like squirrels running in my brain.
- 🌱 I’m currently enhancing my skillset of software release management practices
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on AboveVTT - the simplest, most accessible VTT for playing D&D with native D&D Beyond integration.
- 📫 How to reach me as Stumpy#3427 in Discord
